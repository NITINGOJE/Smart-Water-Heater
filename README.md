Smart Water Heater with temperature display:
Every year, significant electricity wastage occurs due to various reasons. To conserve electricity, we developed the "Heater with Temperature Display" project.
It focuses on controlling water temperature and flow rates to save power. While solar water heaters are energy-efficient, 
our project addresses the need for accurate temperature monitoring in traditional electric heaters, enabling automatic shutdown to conserve power.
